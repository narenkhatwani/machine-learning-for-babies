# Machine Learning for Babies
I tried learning Machine Learning concepts for a long time but I couldn't find a good resource. Eventually this Fall (Fall 2024) I opted for the Machine Learning course at my university (NJIT) under Prof Khalid Bakhshaliyev. He held a discussion-based class and it was quite good.

One of the key resources he gave us to revise the concepts he taught in class was video-recorded lectures by Dr Yiannis Koutis. My classmate Sarang Patil and I have nicknamed Dr Koutis as the ML legend amongst ourselves because he has provided us with the best possible learnings.

One of the key things while learning Machine Learning or any concepts is to understand the fundamentals of it. Those fundamentals are something that Dr Koutis made us understand in simple terms. 

I cannot upload the lectures of Dr Koutis for obvious reasons, but I have made my own notes of what I understood from his lectures and I am uploading them here. If it helps anyone understand any concept in Machine Learning, I and Sarang would be very happy.
